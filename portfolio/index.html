        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>

            <p>Hello, my name is Rhonmark Samson. I have migrated from the Philippines in April of 2015. I was 17 at that time and now I am 24 years old.
                I used to study in University of the East in my hometown which is the Philippines, I used to study Bachelor of Science in Information and Technology (BSIT)
                But due to need of migrating in Canada I have only finished a full year in the University. Since then I had to re-do High School here in Canada to get the requirement to attend University or College.
                I have graduated in Bishop McNally High School which is located in Calgary, Alberta. I was in Batch of 2017.
            </p>
            <p>When in the Philippines up to this day I still like working with computers I used to fix our very own computer at home or our neighbors computers, also I was learning about trading and stocks in general since I was 13 years old.
                When I was in high school in the Philippines I was in the school varsity (Basketball) since freshman until my senior year. But due to change of interest when I got here in Canada I have never tried joining a varsity team as I was full comitted on learning how to trade stocks and other instruments.
                But I have manage to join our Robotics Team at Bishop Mcnally High School for the two years I was there, we did compete with other schools and fortunately won when it was my last year in Bishop Mcnally.
            </p>

            <p>Seven Years later, I now trade for a company called FTMO for about a year now, I only do it part time now as It still my dream to work in Technology.</p>

        <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>

            <p>I may have not so much experiences in the past but in High School when I can proudly say that I contributed to when we won the Robotics Competition in 2017
                I was part of the building the structure of our machine at the time which help us win the competiton.
            </p>
            <p>Work related experience I would say I don't have much experiences,
                since I only had two jobs since I was 17 years old which was from Enterprice Car Rental and Amazon which is my present work.
            </p>

        <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>

            <p>One of my favorite hobby is playing video games, I used to play video game since I was a kid. We had Nintendo and Playstation back then.
                I used to stay up late just playing video games. I mainly play Firs Person Shooter Games such as Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Battlefield.
                But I mainly play on my gaming computer now instead of console, as I think gaming computer gives you better experiences than console, but I still have my consoles such as Ninetendo Switchm and Playstaion 5.
            </p>
            <p>While playing video games are fun, I also play a lot of Basketball up to this day, it is one of my favorite outdoor hobby other than skateboarding and snowboarding in summer.
                I also like going out with friends every weekends, sometimes going for a drive out of town.
            </p>
