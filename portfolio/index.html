            <a href="index.html"><img src="images/ME.jpg" alt="Sample Portrait of Rhonmark Samson" width="200" height=""></a>

            <p>Hello, my name is Rhonmark Samson. I have migrated from the Philippines in April of 2015. I was 17 at that time and now I am 24 years old.
                I used to study in University of the East in my hometown which is the Philippines, I used to study Bachelor of Science in Information and Technology (BSIT)
                But due to need of migrating in Canada I have only finished a full year in the University. Since then I had to re-do High School here in Canada to get the requirement to attend University or College.
                I have graduated in Bishop McNally High School which is located in Calgary, Alberta. I was in Batch of 2017.
            </p>
            <p>When in the Philippines up to this day I still like working with computers I used to fix our very own computer at home or our neighbors computers, also I was learning about trading and stocks in general since I was 13 years old.
                When I was in high school in the Philippines I was in the school varsity (Basketball) since freshman until my senior year. But due to change of interest when I got here in Canada I have never tried joining a varsity team as I was full comitted on learning how to trade stocks and other instruments.
                But I have manage to join our Robotics Team at Bishop Mcnally High School for the two years I was there, we did compete with other schools and fortunately won when it was my last year in Bishop Mcnally.
            </p>

            <p>Seven Years later, I now trade for a company called FTMO for about a year now, I only do it part time now as It still my dream to work in Technology.</p>
